The simulated Solar Power Tower (SPT) plant comprises 1926 heliostats for concentrating solar energy. The data in the `Heliostat_Field_Layout.xlsx`  represents the layout of the heliostats, and the data in the  `Heliostat_Geo_Parameters.xlsx` provides the size information of the heliostats. 

The `SolTrace software` can simulate the heat flux distribution on the receiver of the SPT plants for various solar altitudes and azimuth conditions using the provided `heliostat data`.

If you need any further information, please feel free to contact us.
